Rules:

1, eat one green food to get one more point;

2, meeting one black food will deduct one point(black food never disappear);

3, after the tranditional death, the final score is your final point(not the higheset during the game).

Tips: 

1, just give up when you find it impossible to get one green food without meeting black food in the path;

2, as an author, the fact that my highest score in my career is just about 25 makes me feel shamed;

3, really a hard game cos the overwhelming vindictive food make you hurry scurry... 



P.S. i upload a zipped rar file, while contains the directly runnable exe version on windows.
